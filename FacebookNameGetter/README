This distribution includes the following files, which comprise the Java library for interacting with the Facebook API:
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookRestClient.java -> main class of the library; your code should create an instance of this class and call its methods 
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookMethod.java -> enumeration of methods
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookException.java -> very simple exception class
 - com/facebook/api/ProfileField.java -> enumeration of profile fields

It also includes the following files showing example uses of the library:
 - com/facebook/api/ExampleClient.java
 - settings.conf

To use the ExampleClient, edit settings.conf and replace the api_key and secret with your own, and make sure to add bin/BrowserLauncher2-10rc4.jar to your classpath (for example, via "java -cp bin/BrowserLauncher2-10rc4.jar").
